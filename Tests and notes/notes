* All obervations here are on Serial only, no WiFi

* Intestingly, ADDR->SDA first seems to reduce the static of this ADS1115 chip.
* Otherwise it's quite a noticable difference. All signals seem to float between -4 and +15, with some noise reaching a bit further.
*            
*                        | n: sps (channels = n*2) @1000 delay
*            ADDR to SDA | 1: 400 | delay @950 is too fast
*            ADDR to VDD | 2: 335
*            ADDR to SCL | 3: 287
*            ADDR to GND | 4: 252 | delay @720 works for 293sps
*
*    WiFi enabled, I am able to acquire about 285sps on 8 channels.
