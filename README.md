# ADC-Stream-ESP32S
Using a NodeMCU ESP32S board to stream data received by an ADS1115. Intent is to detect sEMG readings to identify hand gestures.

# Dependencies
The included dependencies contain libraries that have been modified to suit my needs. These are not the same as the original repositories.
